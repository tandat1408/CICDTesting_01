I'll help you fix these TypeScript errors. Let me first examine the files to understand the issues. Now I can see the issues:

1. **`App.tsx`**: React is imported but not used directly (this is common in newer React versions with JSX transform)
2. **`vite.config.ts`**: The `test` property is not recognized because we need to import the correct type

Let me fix these issues: 
```

```

```

```
Actually, let me use a better approach for the vite config. Let me check if there's a better way to type this: 
```

```
Let me fix the vite config properly by using the correct import: 
```

```
Let me try a simpler approach by merging the vite and vitest config: 
```

```
Now let's check if the errors are resolved by running a type check: Great! The errors have been fixed. Let me also run a build to verify everything is working:
